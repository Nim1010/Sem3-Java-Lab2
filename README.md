Overview:
This lab project focuses on building a complete JavaFX desktop application that performs full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a MySQL database. The application connects to a studentdb database and interacts with a students table, allowing users to insert new records, view all data in a TableView, update existing records by ID, and delete records.
The application uses JDBC for database connectivity and provides user feedback using alert dialogs.

Contributions:
I personally worked on:
Setting up the JavaFX application environment in Visual Studio Code. 
Implementing INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE functionalities using PreparedStatement
Structuring the Student class to represent database records (model class)
Testing the application with sample data

I used AI-generated suggestions to:
Designing the GUI layout using JavaFX controls like TextField, Button, TableView, and Label
Setting up JDBC connections properly
Implementing validation and exception handling

The integration of JavaFX UI and JDBC backend was done manually, step by step.
